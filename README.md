# Crypt-DAC
This project implements a secure and flexible access control mechanism for cloud data using cryptographic techniques. Unlike traditional access control systems that depend on a trusted cloud server, this system enforces access rights directly through encryption, ensuring that only authorized users can decrypt and access the data.
